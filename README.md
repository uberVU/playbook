uberVU Playbook
========

Welcome to the uberVU Playbook. The book you are reading right now is designed to give you a thorough rundown of everything that is related to uberVU. More important than the technological aspects, the book strives to contour the team’s culture, its values, its vision, its goals.

Through the years we had many engineers join our team and go through all sorts of onboarding experiences. Some were lean and friendly, but most were brutal and frustrating. You are now part of the new generation who will be alleviated of much of the frustration of discovering the large uberVU ecosystem on your own. 

You will be presented with all the details you need to quickly understand what the product is about, what the team looks like, how our system is built, what tools you have at your disposal and many other details to help you jump right into our team’s culture. You will get to see all the reasoning and work needed to be done for a feature to be designed, implemented and deploy to production.

Furthermore, as you start to build features and explore more of our system you will have a cornerstone to refer back to for details any time you feel like you would have forgotten something. This makes this book suitable not only for new members, but for existing ones as well.

We consider that once you iterate at least once through the content of this book you have all the necessary knowledge to tackle issues in any part of uberVU.
