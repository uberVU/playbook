#Team Values
---

    It's very important for people to know themselves and understand what their value system is, because if you don't know what your value system is, then you don't know what risks are worth taking and which ones are worth avoiding.
                                                - Benjamin Carson, neurosurgeon



Let’s present some of the more abstract concepts that make up uberVU: our values. With time, these values rose from the people working here. They are the basis to the ways we think and act. They are not only related to uberVU, but to everything that we do: hobbies, family, social lives etc.

###Ownership & Responsibility

We hold high standards to our work because we build it as if it were built firstly for ourselves and secondly for our clients. We are very opinionated on always using the best products available; therefore our work has to be the same. Our team is built around the concept that everything that we do is accomplished with a high sense of responsibility and we trust that every member holds the same benchmarks like we do.

###Empowerment

We like to think that empowerment is one core value that creates a key difference between uberVU and other companies. We try to create a free flow of information, relax boundaries between teams and departments and instill the self-management culture. We think that equipped with complete knowledge about the system and a common vision every individual is capable of making independent and effective decisions in our work without having the need for approval from any forms of management. 

###Entrepreneurship

Understanding entrepreneurship is a key factor in succeeding in the uberVU environment. After all we are a startup and not a corporation. We need to move fast and learn from both success and failure. We change direction quickly if new opportunities arise. On top of this, each and every one of us strives to continuously better himself in order to find new solutions to our problems and innovate in the company.

###Client Focus

We learned that building a SaaS is not necessarily about building software, but about creating solutions for our clients. That’s why every decision we take is based on one fundamental question: What end-customer need do we solve by doing this? If we cannot answer this question then it means we should probably spend our time doing something else.


###Work-Life Balance

Having a sense of ownership on what we do sometimes can keep us working day and night to get something shipped. We learned how to balance this with time spent for ourselves as well. We try to compensate exhaustion and burnout  by having active social & private lives. We are also true believers that a healthy mind cannot reside in an unhealthy body and we often engage in sports, be it with the uberVU team or individually.
